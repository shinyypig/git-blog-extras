# Welcome to Git Blog

The first thing you need to do is to git clone the `_config` repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone http(s)://<ip|domain>:<port>/_config
```

The default username and password are `admin` and `admin`. You can change them in `_config/config.json`. The config file should be like this:

```json
{
    "AnaylzePostsOnStart": false,
    "BlogHeader": "Git Blog",
    "BlogTitle": "Git Blog",
    "PostDefaultState": "private",
    "GitPassword": "admin",
    "GitUserName": "admin",
    "WebPort": "8080",
    "WebIP": ""
}
```

After you have changed the config file, remember to push it to the remote repository.

```bash
git push origin main
```

Then restart the server in your website machine.

## Posts

If you want to add a new post, you need to create a folder in your local machine, and then create a `README.md` file in the folder. The `README.md` file should be like this:

```markdown
<!-- private -->

# Post Title

Simple description of the post.

## Post Subtitle

....
```

In this case, the server will auto extract the title and description of the post. The first line is the state of the post. It can be `private` or `public`. If it is `private`, the post will not be shown in the webpage. When you think the post is ready, you can change the state to `public`. If the first line is the title or simply other things, the post will be set to the default state.

If you want to add images to the post, you can create a folder (for example `assests`) in the post folder, and quote the images in the `README.md` file like this:

```markdown
![image](assets/image.png)
```

As long as the images are properly shown in your local machine, they will be properly shown in the webpage.

If you want to delete a post, add the following code to the first line of `README.md`, then the server will automatically delete the repository.

```markdown
<!-- delete -->
```

## Configuration

The configuration file is `_config/config.json`. You can change the following settings:

-   `AnaylzePostsOnStart`: Whether to analyze posts on start. Usually you don't need to change it, unless you manually change contents in the data folder in the server.

-   `BlogHeader`: The header of the webpage. It will be shown in the top of the webpage.
-   `BlogTitle`: The title of the webpage. It will be shown in the tab of the browser.
-   `PostDefaultState`: The default state of the post. It can be `private` or `public`. If it is `private`, the post will not be shown in the webpage.
-   `GitPassword`: The password of the git user. You should change it to a more secure password.
-   `GitUserName`: The username of the git user. You should change it as you like.
-   `WebPort`: The port of the web server.
-   `WebIP`: The IP of the web server. If it is empty, the server will listen to all IPs.

In addition, in the `_config` folder, there are also `static` and `templates` folders. You can change the favicon and the style of the webpage in the `static` folder. You can change the template of the webpage in the `templates` folder.

## Customize

You can customize the index, about, and contact pages by cloning the `_pages` repository to your local machine, and then change the `index.md`, `about.md`, and `contact.md` files in the `_pages` folder. After that, push the changes to the remote repository.

In addition, you can find the information of all posts in the `_pages/postsList.json` file. It is auto generated by the server. Though you can change it manually, it is not recommended. If something goes wrong after you changed it, you need to set `AnaylzePostsOnStart` to `true` in the config file, and then restart the server.
